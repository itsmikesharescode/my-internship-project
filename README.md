## About 
During my internship at Annapolis Credit Management Services, INC., my IT head assigned me a project focusing on "Annapolis Finance," a company wing offering various features like user authentication, buying/selling functionalities, chat systems, and a dynamic content management system. Unfortunately, due to time constraints and numerous revisions, the project's requirements grew beyond the scope of my internship timeframe. As a result, I was unable to complete it before my internship concluded.
